# VoIP System with Asterisk and Softphones

## Project Overview

This project involves setting up a VoIP (Voice over IP) system using Asterisk, an open-source software implementation of a PBX (Private Branch Exchange), and softphones. The project covers basic to advanced configurations, including secure communication, voicemail, additional call features, a web interface for management, real-time monitoring, database integration, and API development.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a robust and secure VoIP system suitable for small office environments or remote teams. By leveraging Asterisk and softphones, we aim to provide a comprehensive solution for voice communication over IP networks.

## Prerequisites

-   Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu)
-   Basic knowledge of Linux command line and networking concepts
-   Internet connection for downloading required software
-   Asterisk (open-source PBX software)
-   Softphones (e.g., Zoiper, X-Lite)

## Installation

### Setting Up the Linux Environment

1.  Install a Linux distribution on a virtual machine (VM) or a dedicated server.
2.  Update the package list:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo apt-get update` 
    

### Installing Asterisk

1.  Install necessary dependencies:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo apt-get install wget build-essential subversion` 
    
2.  Download and install Asterisk:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `cd /usr/src
    sudo wget http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/asterisk-18-current.tar.gz
    sudo tar -xvf asterisk-18-current.tar.gz
    cd asterisk-18*/
    sudo contrib/scripts/install_prereq install
    sudo ./configure
    sudo make
    sudo make install
    sudo make samples
    sudo make config
    sudo ldconfig` 
    

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

1.  Edit the `sip.conf` file to configure SIP protocol for VoIP:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo nano /etc/asterisk/sip.conf` 
    
    Add the following configuration:
    
    ini
    
    Copy code
    
    `[general]
    context=default
    bindport=5060
    bindaddr=0.0.0.0
    
    [1001]
    type=friend
    secret=1001pass
    qualify=yes
    nat=yes
    host=dynamic
    context=default
    canreinvite=no
    
    [1002]
    type=friend
    secret=1002pass
    qualify=yes
    nat=yes
    host=dynamic
    context=default
    canreinvite=no` 
    
2.  Edit the `extensions.conf` file to define the dial plan:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo nano /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf` 
    
    Add the following configuration:
    
    ini
    
    Copy code
    
    `[default]
    exten => 1001,1,Dial(SIP/1001,20)
    exten => 1001,n,VoiceMail(1001@default,u)
    exten => 1001,n,Hangup()
    
    exten => 1002,1,Dial(SIP/1002,20)
    exten => 1002,n,VoiceMail(1002@default,u)
    exten => 1002,n,Hangup()` 
    

### Advanced Configuration

-   **Security**: Implement TLS for SIP signaling, SRTP for media encryption, and use `fail2ban` for brute-force attack protection.
-   **Voicemail**: Set up a voicemail system for each extension with email notifications.
-   **Call Features**: Configure call forwarding, call waiting, and conference calling.

## Softphone Setup

1.  Install a softphone application (e.g., Zoiper, X-Lite) on your computer or mobile device.
2.  Configure the softphone with the following settings:
    -   **Username**: 1001 (or 1002 for the second extension)
    -   **Password**: 1001pass (or 1002pass for the second extension)
    -   **Domain**: IP address or hostname of the Asterisk server
    -   **Port**: 5060

## User Interface and Real-Time Monitoring

-   Develop a web interface using a framework like Flask or Django for managing extensions and viewing call logs.
-   Implement a real-time monitoring dashboard to display active calls, registered users, and system performance metrics.

## Database Integration

-   Integrate a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store user and call data.
-   Configure Asterisk to use the database for managing extensions and logging call details.

## API Development

-   Develop a RESTful API for adding, updating, and deleting extensions programmatically.
-   Ensure the API is secure and provides necessary endpoints for managing the VoIP system.

## Security

-   Implement security measures such as TLS, SRTP, and `fail2ban` to protect the VoIP system.
-   Regularly update and patch the system to address security vulnerabilities.

## Testing

-   Conduct thorough testing of the entire setup, including making calls between extensions, verifying voicemail functionality, and checking the security measures.
-   Monitor the system performance and make necessary adjustments to optimize it.

## Challenges and Solutions

-   Document any challenges faced during the project and the solutions implemented to overcome them.

## Learning Outcomes

-   Gained hands-on experience with VoIP, SIP, and RTP protocols.
-   Learned how to configure and manage Asterisk PBX.
-   Developed skills in Linux administration, network security, and web development.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive understanding of VoIP systems and their practical applications. The setup and configuration of Asterisk and softphones, combined with advanced features and security measures, offer a robust solution for voice communication over IP networks.
